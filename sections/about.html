                Greetings, I'm Yadhukrishnan Pankajakshan, a proactive programming student with a diverse skill set
                spanning both data science and software engineering. Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer
                Science at Northeastern University in San Jose, California, I bring over 2 years of industry experience
                and a solid foundation in a range of programming languages, including Javascript, Java, Python, and
                more.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my journey, I've tackled complex challenges, coded transaction marking algorithms handling thousands
                of concurrent users, and crafted data-driven solutions. I am now seeking an internship opportunity where
                I can seamlessly blend my skills in data science and software engineering to contribute to cutting-edge
                projects. My commitment to innovation, coupled with a strong academic background, positions me as a
                valuable asset to any team.
            </p>
